Title: Fitting Common and Shared Atoms Nested Models via MCMC

Description: An R package for estimating Bayesian nested mixture models via MCMC methods. Specifically, the package implements the common atoms model (Denti et al., 2023), its finite version (D'Angelo et al., 2023), and a hybrid finite-infinite model. All models use Gaussian mixtures with a normal-inverse-gamma prior distribution on the parameters. Additional functions are provided to help analyzing the results of the fitting procedure.
